"""The demo's shaders must be the plugin's shaders, character for character.

    python3 demo/tools/check_shaders.py

Called from `tools/verify.sh`. Exit code 1 means the two copies have drifted.
Galvo's check, by way of clamp, in this repo's shape.

------------------------------------------------------------------- why

`demo/plugin.js` holds three GLSL bodies and so does `source/Shaders.cpp`.
That is two copies of the same text, and two copies drift -- quietly, because a
demo that renders a *plausible* picture looks exactly like a demo that renders
the right one. The whole claim of these pages is that they run the plugin's own
shader rather than something reimplemented to look similar, so the claim needs
something enforcing it.

Nothing else can. `txtest` drives the real plugin class through a real FFGL
sequence and has no idea this page exists, and `tools/verify.sh`'s glslc step
compiles the C++ copies and never looks at the JS one.

------------------------------------------------------------------- what it does

Pulls each `R"( ... )"` body out of the C++ and each matching backtick literal
out of `plugin.js`, and compares them exactly -- no whitespace normalisation, no
comment stripping. The plugin assembles each shader as `kVersion + body`
(`shaders::assemble`); the page does the same with `assemble()`, so the bodies
are what is compared and the one prepended line is checked here as a literal.

The one transformation is a decode, not a normalisation. A backtick cannot
appear raw inside a JavaScript template literal, so `plugin.js` would have to
escape one as \\`; none of these shaders quotes one today, but a comment could
start to. This unescapes that and *rejects any other backslash on the JS side*;
there are none anywhere in the C++, so a second escape could only be somebody
hiding a difference. A `${` would be interpolated by the literal, so it is
refused on the C++ side before it can become a silent difference.

------------------------------------------------------------------- what it cannot

Nothing here checks the *ported* half. The decoder, the encoder, the
transmission, the header, the layout, the controls and the frame sequence in
plugin.js are a hand translation of Decoder.cpp, Encoder.cpp, Transmission.cpp,
Header.cpp, Layout.cpp, Controls.cpp and Teletext::ProcessOpenGL, and only a
reader can tell whether they still agree. When you change one of those, change
it here too -- and remember that a wrong port shows up on the page as a picture
that is subtly wrong, which nobody will notice.
